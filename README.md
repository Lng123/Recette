## Bugs
> The recipe search function will only work when the api is turned on. Since the api is a paid subscription with limited requests per day, it will only function during the time when the team is currently subscribed and uses the javascript file of the api. During the absence of the api, the recipe search results and recipes will be replaced by dummy pages which demonstrate what the pages would look like showing results of fixed dummy ingredients (potato and tomato).

> If it is the case that the search results and recipe pages are empty when viewing files page3.html and page4.html, the api is currently deactivated, and the dummy files are not substituted in its place. To switch to the dummy files In the page3.html and page4.html, switch out the spoonpage3.js and spoonpage4.js files by changing their names or commenting them out, and make sure spoon3dummy.js and spoon4dummy.js are activated (making sure the names are correct). 

## Challenges as a group
> We encoutered many kinds of challenges. First of all, figuring out using the cloud function was one of our hardest challenges because nobody had the experience about cloud functions. Secondly, using OCR and cron job were also difficult to figure it out because when we work with them with cloud functions, we could not find any kind of similiar example on google. Lastly, we had to spend a lot of time fixing up all the UX/UI. We recognized that the most important thing of our app is UX/UX for the convinience of users. Accordingly, we had to spend the most time on this.
